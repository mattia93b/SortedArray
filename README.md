# SortedArray
The project requires the realization of a generic sortedarray class that implements an array in which the elements (generic of type T) are logically maintained in order. To reduce the overhead that would be necessary to keep generic data sorted, the fundamental characteristic of the array is that the inserted T data are physically stored in the order of insertion but, on request, it is possible to logically access it in an orderly manner. The data sorting mechanism MUST NOT PREVENT PHYSICAL COPY / DISPLAY OF THE SAME DATA. In other words, you have to implement an indirect data sorting mechanism. This must limit the cost necessary to copy / move the T data into memory. IT IS NOT ALLOWED TO HAVE TWO ARRAYS OF DATA T: ONE ORDERED AND ONE NOT ORDINATED. The criterion for deciding the ordering of data must be freely definable by the user through the use of functors. The array has a maximum pre-set capacity during construction and elements can be added until capacity is reached.
